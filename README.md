## ToDo Object Detection
- [] Play around with input parameters for edge boxes (can we get better recall?). Most easily done like in the section 'edge boxes' in test_oe.ipynb (should probably be moved to HPC for speed though)
- [] How do 'epochs' work when we just sample batches randomly from class0 and class1? Should we define an epoch as having been through all positive-class examples?
