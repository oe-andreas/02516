## ToDo Object Detection
- [] Play around with input parameters for edge boxes and SS, since our recall/MABO is not very impressive right now. Most easily done like in the section 'edge boxes' in test_oe.ipynb (should probably be moved to HPC for speed though)
- [] Create a training loop. Note that loss should combine regression and classification loss.
- [] Implement NMS for part 3
